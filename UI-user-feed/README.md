## Candidate Notes

### *__[User Interface - User Feed -- Written in VanillaJS](https://github.com/rdhammack88/interview-exercises/tree/master/UI-user-feed)__*

- *__Currently not completed__*
  - Started, and was a little sloppy with a potential of a larger codebase than desired. Left for later completion and comparison to Angular version.
- No need to install anything, just double-click the index.html file to run.
